# ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED FILE

`mappings.json` is **automatically generated** by the GitHub Action `.github/workflows/merge-mappings.yml`

**DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY**

Instead, edit individual game files in the `games/` directory.

## How it works

1. Edit or create a game file in `games/{processName}.json`
2. Commit and push to main branch
3. GitHub Action automatically merges all `games/*.json` into `mappings.json`
4. Changes to `mappings.json` are committed automatically

## Manual regeneration

To manually trigger the merge:
- Go to Actions tab in GitHub
- Select "Merge Game Mappings" workflow
- Click "Run workflow"
